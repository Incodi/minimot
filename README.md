I love data and I love Youtube, so this is a passion project.

Currently this project only has a main application and a downloader application.

The downloader application downloads video subtitles and video metadata from a channel or playlist of choice.

This data can be used in the search application which was not implemented yet.

There is a test "debug" data file with many videos with funny titles and commentary. This can be used to test out the search application.
