I love data and I love Youtube, so this is a passion project.

Currently this project only has a main application and a downloader application.

The downloader application downloads video subtitles and video metadata from a channel or playlist of choice.

This data can be used in the analyzer.

I am currently working on the analyzer tool and have not commited that yet.

The debug tool helps in finding missing subtitle files in case there is an error in the downloader.
