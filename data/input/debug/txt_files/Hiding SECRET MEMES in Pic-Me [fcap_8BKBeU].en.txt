Ah, dudes. Welcome back to another game
of PickMe. Now, we've played this game
on the channel before and you guys
really liked it. If you've never seen it
before, uh, it's the ultimate meme
challenge game. All right. Me, Sunday,
Zod, Mitz, and Nico are going to be
playing this. Here's how it works. One
person is the writer, okay? They look at
all the cards in their hand and they
write a description about their card to
be like, "This reminds me of Zud's
butt." All right. And you put the card
down. Everybody else puts in a card that
reminds them of Zud's butt, too. And
then we try to guess which one was put
in by the writer. For every person the
writer fools, they get a point. or if
they fool everybody cuz their hint's
bad. They don't get any points. Uh but
if you fool somebody else and they guess
your card, you get a point. There's a
whole bunch of other math that goes into
it, too. But basically, you're trying to
be sneaky liy little meme guy. All
right? And uh if they pick you, you get
points. And you know what I need? I need
you guys to pick the like button and
pick the subscribe button. Okay? I need
those things. I'm trying to get to 2
million subs. And then let's go see if I
can pick all these idiots memes and
become a champion.
All right. Welcome back to Pick Me. Uh,
this is the game where we try to use
memes and dreams uh in our uh sense of
humor to get somewhere. That's the name.
I'm going to play this game. Okay. So,
Sunday, uh, you're going to write it.
All right. You're writing the meme.
We're going to put ours down and you're
going to pick your favorite. All right.
It's It's a little like apples to
apples. It's a little like Chameleon.
It's a little like Filian. It's World of
Tanks, right? Yeah. It's a lot like
World of Tanks. Thanks, son. I will come
over there and slap the witch hat off
you. I will. Is this an ad? Oh, yeah.
Oh, am I looking at my cards? No, no,
you can't throw things anymore. How do I
know what word I'm typing? It It's like
the theme for the round.
It's chameleon cuz then you're going to
put one in too. So, it has to be like
we're trying to find yours. Okay. So, it
like describes yours, but it's like
vague enough that we get picked. We're
trying to like fool people. It's not
like apples apples at all except for the
part where it's like apples. I don't
know.
Oh god. You don't want your card to get
chosen when you write mint. That's what
it is. Okay. All right. There is one
card that I have.
Well, if you play it win, we'll blur it.
Why?
I'm just going to see which card speaks
to me in the moment. It's like so easy.
It's so straightforward. I'll have you
know I've never lost one of these games
before. There we go. Okay. Never won one
either. Why' I get negative one point?
You You took too long. I think I think
you literally ran the timeout. Yeah, I
think you literally just I wrote a word
down. I don't I think the time ran out.
Same tab. Why I can't? It pulls up a
menu for me. Wait, what? It pulls up a
scoreboard for me. It pull It just makes
What is happening? Are we different
versions of the game? I don't really Oh,
how do I click send this before?
How do I click send? Hit enter. I don't
know. What do you mean?
What am I saying? It didn't work. Pick a
card. Pick a card. You typed it in chat.
Oh, I didn't mean to. All right. So, the
thing is zombie apocalypse. So now we
pick a card that fits. Oh, and you have
to pick a card. Oh, I get it.
Okay. Okay. I I pull one down. All
right. I activate my trap card. I throw
it in there. Okay. Okay. No, this is
this is good. So, you want to put in a
card that could be a zombie apocalypse.
So, we pick it. The lie thing. Got it.
Okay. Now, we have to find the card that
Nico put in when he wrote zombie
apocalypse. Oh, man. Okay. No, that's
simple. It's definitely that one. Yeah,
it has to be. It has to be.
It has to be. Who hasn't picked one? I'm
going to I'm going to go for a different
one.
Fell away.
Oh, wait. What? Wait, I got it. Three
points. Two people picked me. Oh my
gosh. Okay, so now people get points. If
you fooled somebody, uh, I got zero
points for being deceived by a
trickster. Myth got four. Why did you
get it? Oh, cuz Myth guessed correctly.
Got it. Y I'm the best. Sure. Okay. Uh
let's see. Uh uh next time we should
watch the video before I get it. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Great. Here we go. Pick a
card for him. You send it out. Easy. Dr.
Jones. Dr. Jones.
What in the Bmer? Dude, what? It's um
Who's Dr. Jones? Who isn't Dr. Jones,
Nico? I'm googling it. It's nothing.
It's not a reference to anything. I
don't 70 away. Rock Jones was sung by
Aqua.
Sure. Oh, wait. But we don't want to
guess Sigils is right. No, we do.
So, why would you make it up? But it's
probably that one. Oh gosh, this is
hard, right? This is difficult, right
guys? This is going to be difficult.
Yeah, we did it. We all got one point.
We did it. That was tough. We all get
two points. What? None of you picked
Nico, dude. I thought Nico would have B.
Whatever.
No. Cool. That's fine there. Cool. So
now,
dude, Mits is crushing even Nico, the
undisputed champion. What do we by one?
So going up. Okay.
I like the the sound of Myths panicking.
Uh um you want
Okay. Um, how do I Okay, now click the
card you want to use. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Oh, I get it. Hide. Hide. Oh.
Um, who farted? It was It was It was
That sound like a Z one. I didn't fart.
I I'm honest when I do. Why do you Okay,
sigils. It was you. No. There we go. All
right. There we go. There we go. Easy.
Okay. That was me. That was him.
Oh. Ooh, there's a few that are pretty
that are pretty good. You know what? I
picked this one. I picked this one.
Pooky. I picked this one. Wait, this
one's tough. No. What? You did this one.
Who's the idiot? Okay, never mind. You
guys did great. Destroyed. Three points.
Look who's back. Back again. I don't
think you only got one point, idiot. I
got two. You don't count. Three points
for finding the writer. Let's go. And
then we move towards the center. I don't
understand this game anymore. Oh, I got
plus four. That's good. All right. Okay.
I'm literally winning. All right, Z
right away. Cutie. Um,
why are you giggling?
Editor's going to have to do some work.
Okay. Yay. Oh, stare with these glasses.
So, we know which ones that is. Yeah.
Yeah, we know which ones that is. Yeah.
Oh, yeah. No, you don't know that. I
think we do.
Inappropriate.
Great. Mhm.
But you can't pick mine cuz it's going
to get blurred.
You can't pick it. No, that's how it
works.
Three points and one for That's three
points for that. I got four. Let's go.
Making a comeback. There we go. Bart
poopy butt dingle.
You know what? Let him cook, dude. You
know what? I don't know why he's here.
Um, okay. Question. If you don't get my
card, I get points. Let's see if I found
this system.
That's not a question. That was actually
like a statement. But yeah.
Hey, don't I don't know what I hate. I
hate it. This is not how we should play
this game. That's crazy. I just wanted
to see how it works. And I won't play
like
No. Who guessed me, you idiot? Ah, it
was me. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Two of
them.
We got points except for Ian. I got
three points. Yeah, I got four. That was
good. I Wait, no. Yeah, I got four. I'm
now 11 down.
Eco, can you write a good hint? You
probably can't. M. Look at me. Mits,
look at me. Oh, sorry. He probably
can't. Ian, you ruined this. You've
ruined this. He might be cooking with
what he did. No. No. There's I actually
have a good one.
This is a tough choice, huh? Mhm. If I
fight it again, then I'm I'm winning off
of nonsense. Barley fin is a type of
dinosaur. Yeah, why do I do, too? It's
not mine. Okay. No, this is banned. We
are not playing like this. Wait, I don't
get any points cuz no one guessed mine.
Good. Wait, that's bad. Oh, that's how
they punish you. Oh. Oh, so I got lucky
by you picking mine. Yes. Yes. Yes.
You know what? Good job, game makers.
You stopped my idiot friends. No. Type
out. Okay, let's Mitch and I were not
doing anything bad other than putting
up. I said idiot friends. That's plural.
It doesn't mean all of you. Song by Aqua
that came out in 2018. Let's see. Uh,
can you do an actual hint instead of us?
Yeah, I got you.
I can't wait for the subar hint. Okay.
You know what? You know what? You know
what? It's going to be some like Chad
GPT thing that he writes his book with.
Hey, it's not true. You can't say that
out loud. That one will get sugar. Prove
it. I saw a review and that's that's
what they said.
Dead. What? Dead.
Okay. I mean,
I got it. Okay. I'm I'm guessing on the
contents of this deck. We'll see.
Oh, wow.
Okay.
Huh. Pretty dead with this one.
Oh, wow. Bro, what?
That's insane. We all commented out, but
like what?
We can read you like a That's insane. I
had another card that two more cards
that could have also been that. There
were like three dead bodies and then you
all chose mine. That makes no sense.
How do we play this? I'm not helping.
Oh, these are some good ones. What? This
is literally the same as what I did.
Good ones. I'm doing this one. I'm doing
this one, bro.
What the heck? Are you kidding? Hey,
wait. That's a good score for set, I
think. No, for mids. Yeah, because
because Mids fooled one person. I think
Mid gets max points. Thank you. I got
four. Mid's got three. Bro, bro, this is
insane. How did you all know that?
There's no way that you should all know
that, dude. We're in cahoots right now.
Uh, you're not in the group chat. Wait,
how do you play this game? I'm not
helping. Yeah, the antiig sigils club is
going strong right now and I don't
appreciate pee on my puzzle.
Oh, good hint. Good hint. I said a good
hint. I thank you guys. Thank you.
That was my fastest submission. Yeah.
No, I actually weirdly have one for
this.
Wait, did I lowkey cook on this one? No,
you did not. Yeah. No, that was a good
hint. Ooh,
wait.
It could be all of these. Wow. Yeah, but
like not in a good way.
It's definitely top left, but I didn't
vote for that.
Okay, top right is typo. I found it. How
