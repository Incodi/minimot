After 9:00 p.m., all phone calls like,

chunks of wood got me, but that's okay.
What's a little splinter to the face?
What's a bowling ball to the face? You
know exactly. Back in my day, people
were made of tougher stuff. I walk down
the street and the mayor would hit me
with a bowling ball and I'd say, "Thank
you, sir. May I have some more?"
Kids today are too soft. People don't
throw enough bowling balls at their
faces. That's true. Bunk is a hammer to
face. I was hoping that would do well.
No hammer for the not for me. Ow. Hammer
for you and not
stew.
No hammers for stool. He's had enough.
Damn. Why did that not explode? No more
hammer stew. Oh man, you're getting
worked, bro. Yeah, I'm getting wrecked.

issue. I needed to look more like Homer
Simpson. Now I can't lose. Uh-oh. Oh my
god. That chicken rules. Ow. Made. I'm a
genius. Chris, the ball missed me cuz I
was too busy doing a sweet front flip. I
definitely didn't get hurt more falling
down. Are you sure? It looks like he got
hurt. I'm pretty sure. Oh, the chicken
got him. He's doing the chicken dance.
Chris,

wouldn't let me chicken dance at her
wedding. She banned it. What? We chicken
danced at my wedding. What? Oh, I'm so
mad. We chicken dance and do the
electric sled. The electric sled? No,
sled. cuz it's past tense.
You're right. I'm sorry. Banana. Oh,
that guy exploded the Why did I just
die? That made no sense whatsoever.
That's not how I threw it. I threw that
there. Just huck this over there. Oh, it
explodes on contact. I was hoping it
would Oh, the banana explodes into more
bananas. Now I've got it. I figured it
out, Chris. I figured it out. I figured

the guys named Sea Top that are
currently in the room. I did it. Kill
him. Yes. Yes. I'm only going to jail
for two of these three murders. Huzah.
Who's your favorite band? Is it Mace of
Bass? Yeah. That doesn't even make
sense. It's close enough. You think I'm

Get him, doggy. Oh no, doggy. Uh-oh.
My doggy exploded. Get him in the face.
He explodes. He knocks him over. Oh, I
got to go for the back guy first. He
throws knives at the front guy. That's
always better. Uh-oh. This is going to
hurt.
Survive. Yes. Survive. Live. Here we go.
Live. Don't miss. Uh-oh.
I've never seen someone biff it that bad
in my life. Ah. Well, now you have. No,
I wasn't looking. Have you met my friend
Biff? Biff Tannon. Ah. Which Biff? Is it
the rich Biff or the not rich Biff? Or
the Wild West Biff or Old Biff? Gosh,
Chris. All those fo poor Biff. Old West
Biff was rich and friends. No, he
wasn't. He had no friends. No one knows
what we're talking about.
Why did you put all these various biffs
on the screen and if John doesn't
understand it either, then we're
screwed. Oh, double rocket. Heck yeah.
I'll make the sound effects. Drop him on
the barrel. There we go.
Uh-uh. I curse my height. Too tall and
awesome. You're not tall.
Grenade to the face shouldn't do more
than 44 freaking damage. Or you just
talking about in the game. I threw a
rock at me and did like a million. Maybe
you should be upgrading them. Maybe I
should upgrade to you. Uh-uh.
What a doofus. Blow him up. The little
bananas going hit me in the face and I
died. Dang it. Cheers. Chers. Chuggers.
You did another
dog. Didn't even bite him. Okay,
chicken. Can I get this back to you guys
with a chicken explode? Uh-oh. Okay.
Hopefully the little bananas don't come
and hit me. I got to stop throwing the
banana. Stop throwing bananas. Can't
help it. Even though we won. My mother
was a monkey. Oh, I won. Yeah,

before I did. How was this difficult? I
should have probably knocked him down
with explosive or something. What a
loser. Mhm. Okay, checkers. Yeah, good
boy. Yeah. Oh my god, Jack is strong as
heck. Yeah. All right, Jackers. I'm just
going to just gonna arc you. Get get on.

like the dickens. Scissors.
Oh my god. It's just a bunch of doofases
hawking stuff. Stop dying. Stop doing
splinters and died. All right, banana

will go everywhere. I was really hoping
they wouldn't have hit me, but then they
did. No, I don't want the phone. Look at
this. Face to face. Mono emano. No.
You who has mono? I probably shouldn't
do the ones that explode cuz he's right
in front of me. Huh? Okay. All right. I
need to get the bananas stuck back there
so they don't hit me. There we go.
Perfection. Incarnate. Wa. Something
