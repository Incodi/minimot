Hi dudes. Welcome back to another toxic
Minecraft video. Today me, Sunny,
Bibble, and Zud are going to be trying
to find dumb ways to die in Minecraft.
That's right. We've designed an obstacle
course full of some of the dumbest ways
you can possibly die in Minecraft. We
have to figure out how to do it. Each
round, there'll be a custom way. We're
supposed to figure out how to die, solve
the puzzle, be the first one to do it.
Whoever dies first gets a point. At the
end, whoever has the most points is the
winner. To do this, you're going to need
three things. You're going to need
bravery, going to need intelligence, and
a nerdy level of understanding of
Minecraft. Fortunately, I have all of
those. And you know, you have the
responsibility to hit the subscribe
button. Okay, I'm trying to get to 2
million subs. It's up to you. Also, the
responsibility to hit this like button.
Okay, I need to feed my family. So, do
that. And uh let's go see if we can die
dumber than our friends.
Are you guys ready to die and incredibly
stop? This is not how we're supposed to
die. No, that gives me points. That
gives me points. What? No. What? Okay,
that's a smart way to die. Remember,
because this is a race.
And you broke it. And he broke it. Just
Why is he here? Who won? And he broke
it. No, I just You're just You're just
not supposed to be here. You're not
supposed to do Yeah. The admins are mad.
I can feel their anger simmering. Give
me my point back. No.
Thanks, Biffle. Thank you, Biffle. Thank
you. I got you. I got you. Okay, look.
We're going to level one, which is over
here, obviously. Not over there. Don't
go over there. You guys be idiots.
Whoever dies first gets the point. No
reason. Don't worry about it. Level one.
Uh, okay. Nope. Nothing in the chest.
Wait. Chest. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait.
Hey. No. No. No. Come on. Okay. No. No.
No. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get
it. I get it. I get it. Wait, did you
already get something that's for
something? Bipp, there's no way you just
Are you an idiot? There's no way. What'
I do? That's a movie, actually. No, you
made it to where I don't take fall
damage. You're stupid, Admin. Why' they
both try that? I don't know. I don't
know. I don't know. You better craft
fast enough. You better craft fast
enough. You better cry fast enough. I
don't understand what you're doing. I'm
confused. Wait, do we sing the song?
Yeah. Yeah. You have to sing it. You
have to sing it. Dumb ways to die. Hold
on. Dumb
mining. Why is riffle playing Minecraft?
I don't know what I'm doing. What is
this? Wait, hold on. I think I think I
got boozled.
Do I need to do it? No. I I think I got
boozled because the biome is wrong.
Maybe it's coded in to blow up. Anyways,
you should maybe stay away from me.
Wait, we have a hint, but I'm not ready.
Stop following me. You guys are so
weird. Just Just do the thing, man.
Oh, it actually is that. Wait, hang on.
Why did it kill Ian? Wait, no, no, no.
Why did it kill pointies?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm so
mad.
All right, so even though it wasn't the
Nether biome, it was still it was still
a setup. Got it. All right, you guys
ready for level two? Yeah. Yeah. Fine.
Don't yell at me. All right, level two.
Um, okay. H, what's in there? There was
nothing. Nothing. Nothing. What was in
it? That's not fair. Well, you get some.
I get it. That is not fair. I agree. But
you know what? Here we are. I'll tell
you what it is. It was 32 chicken spawn
eggs.
Oh, and the chickens probably some for
some reason kill us. No, that wouldn't
happen. Wait, no.
No. I No. No. I feel like feel like I
know what this is. I feel like I know
what this is. We grief. I'm griefing.
Are we allowed to build? Yeah, I am. I
think so. Wait, what was that?
Son, get out. Son, no. There's no way.
Son, go away. Son, go away. No. No. No.
No. No way. We're all in here, dude.
Okay. Okay. Is this entity cramming?
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's entity
cramming.
I don't I think you do a lot more than
whatever you get. Well, I only got 32,
dude. Wait. Wait. Oh my. Why? Oh, it's
cuz I punched I punched him and it
crammed them to me, bro. Yeah, I punched
him. So, I made it work for me, not you.
Obviously, when you punch chickens, when
there's 32 of them, it turns into zombie
piglins. That is a dumb way to die,
right, guys? Mhm. How How am I not dying
any of these way? What do you mean?
What? Get out of my face. You guys are
so mean. All right, let's play level
three. I have a sign. That's not how it
works.
Why? Why is that how it works? You
pressed it earlier and it was like that,
you idiot. That's called redstone,
buddy. No, it's not redstone. Okay, hold
I know what this has to be. Buddy,
buddy, buddy. Okay, there's definitely
an invisible something. You can't break
the floor. No one said I couldn't. Hold
on. It was breaking the floor. Bibble.
I'm sure underneath. No, that's bedrock.
What? Oh, okay. Why are you shifting on
things? You freaking Oh, I know. Why?
Dude, I just keep watching. Why would
you say that out loud?
I was told by the time what's not right.
What does holding shift do? It We think
that there's a powdered snow block
amongst the white concrete. Then you'll
see it won't. No, it blends in. We have
the texture pack on. Yeah, I'm turning
it off.
No, I don't. Well, you should put it on,
you idiot. Is that why you saw zombie
pigment earlier? Still no difference.
Yeah, I know. The That's why you saw
zombie pigman. I hate you. Oh, is it
something else? Yeah, it was just
chickens. Oh, sorry.
Oh, you're so dumb. It's not my fault.
I'm so confused. What do we What is the
like? Yeah. Yeah, there's a hint, but I
have it. No, I have it. I have it. Look
at this. You have the hint. So, you get
to choose what we get. You know what? I
got the power. That's it. We're doing
old style. Old style. Come here. Stay
away. Stay away.
Okay. All right. Fine. Fine. You're
probably lagging. Try relogging.
Reloing. Reload so fast. I've logged so
hard. Already logged out. Log so hard.
Oh, people died. Wait. Oh, it was just
logging out. Wait, everyone's died. Do
that. You have no Wait, show the ID.
Wait, no. Yeah, of course. I have it
saved. Uh, how does Wait. Yes, we all
got a point. What just happened? You
have no home or bed or charge respawn
anchor or it was obstructed. Now that
that was a dumb way to die. I don't get
it. Is this Among Us one? No. You know,
let's go over here to level two. Let's
try this one. Level four. Level four.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
There's no way it's that easy. There's
no way it's that easy. I was already in
here first. Oh no. We're getting effect.
Hey. Uh water breathing. Yeah. No,
there's no way. Why do I have water
breathing all of a sudden? That's really
weird. Yeah. Weird. Okay. Cuz that's
maybe the dumber way to die. H. Oh, I
know what to do. And then we need to do
this and the this and then this and then
this and then this. Do I know what to
do? No. You idiot. No, you know what to
do. Stop yelling at me. I think I know
what to do. What?
I need to craft a a thingy. Okay. If I
make a boat and I get in the boat and I
just spin around.
When I spin around, then I'll get dizzy
and die. No. Watch this. You're so good
at this. Ready? Watch this. Like get out
of the boat. He's serious. Oh gosh. Oh
gosh. Oh gosh. Wait. You know what?
Wait, what? That was actually the That
was a What? Oh, wait. Oh, I thought we
were getting yelled at, so I got out.
Wait, how did we die? How do you I
actually got nervous. We upset the
admin. Uh Z got out cuz he thought he
was in trouble for breaking the video. I
know. I legit thought I was in trouble,
so I got out of the boat, which killed
Sals. Stupid. What the heck? That's Say

we're dumb. No, Sunny's really going to
say that. Sunny can say it. Sunny, can

Okay, put it down. One. Stupidest thing
I've ever seen. Two. And then three. And

All right, fine. The temptation is too
much. It's too much for us. Why am I
losing hunger? Well, the challenge.
Yeah. Okay. Um I guess we dig up the
entire arena. Maybe there's a piece of
redstone. That's what I'm wondering. No,

broke it. Wait, who broke it? Who broke
it? Now we can't play the game. Great. I
