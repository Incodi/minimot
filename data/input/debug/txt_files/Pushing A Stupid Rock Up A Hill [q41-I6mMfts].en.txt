rhythm, right? Uh we can go up the left,
mate. Red, green. Yeah, that's left.
We'll have to go up the right surely.
This is like yellow. Orange. Oh, that
right.
I don't think the ball's got to fit
through that gap to get it up there,
mate. Well, maybe it is just a walking
path. Hey, the right's a different
story, though, mate. We could take it up
right side. If the ball comes down this
thing, it starts at the start. Like,
we're at the start. Pack it in. Zoom in
and out with the uh arrow keys, mate.
Blue, pink, middle. Middle. Let's just
FUCK sake it. See how bad. Oh, it

never been huge on cosmetics anyway,
mate. It's fine. Crowny. Crowny wants
the FUCK cat ears, mate. I can tell.

the right. I can go as well, mate.
Should we try further left, mate? Start
further left.
Oh no.
Won't be fast enough, man. Yeah, we
definitely want to go up when it's
swinging from the right, mate. There's
more space to work with on the left.
Loads more space on the left, mate. A

up to it, George. You know, think it was
a guy left. I was about who's pushing it
off. It was me. Oh, FUCK FUCK FUCK
