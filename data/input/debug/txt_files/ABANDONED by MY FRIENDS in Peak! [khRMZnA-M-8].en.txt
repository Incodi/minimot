Hi dudes. Welcome to a mistake. Yep,
that's right. Maybe the biggest mistake
I've ever made. Look at me. Look at how
angry I am. Look at the expression on my
face. Well, today I'm playing a game
called Peak. This game is unlike my
career, which has never peaked. It's us
trying to get to the top of mountain.
That's right. In this game, me, Jerome,
Biffle, and Sud are crash landed on an
island. We have to work together to
survive climbing the world's most awful
mountain. It's randomly generated. Every
day it's different. And uh, as you can
see, I've assembled a cracked group of
troops to make this work. This game is
infuriating, but it's also incredible.
So, do me a favor. You want us to play
it again? Hit the like button. Okay.
Also, hit the subscribe button if you're
new around here. I'm trying to beat Zub
to a million subs twice, so help me do
that. Look at my eyebrows. They're nice.

are the people that we surround
ourselves with. Do you guys think that

plane? Dr. Why did your private jet
crash? Also, I'm starting to realize
something. Boy Scouts, why are you
following me? You just happen to be
going the way that I want to go. Right.
Right. Wait, I have a compass. Oh, that
was my compass. We needed that. We're

this. Hey, you got to go slow, buddy.
Follow my light, boys. We're literally

just I am the path. Sometimes you have
to go down to go up. Come here. I'm
about to throw you off to the I want to
come play the game with my friends. You
commute with a cursed skull. That's on
you. How was I supposed to know the
cursed skull was cursed, Andrew? Well,
usually it said curse. It means curse.
Climbed before. He doesn't understand up
to go down. Shut up. I'm going to I'm
going to Great. Hi. What? How are you
more annoying while dead? Hi. I'm
familiar with you. Unfortunately, it's
been like seven long years. To the left.
And there's bridges we can take. You
see, I'm starting to find the bridges
that we were just at. I'm going to kill
you. Those aren't the same bridges, you
stupid idiot. I had to chop you off this
mountain. I'm a sigils on the edge.
Look, I also brought us to a crate in a
bush. You love crates. Well, that's I
do. That's just crates. Oh, yeah. That's
Jerome luggage if I've ever seen one
before. Who are they?
Do you hear his voice like going nuts? I
think they can mimic our voices. They're
mimicking our voices. Hey, idiots. Hey,
I'm here to haunt you guys. Do you make
fun of us? Hey, Dumbos. Dumbos, don't
just tried to shove me off. Ble just
tried to commit a murder. Of course I
did. I want to see you as a ghost. It'
be funny. Okay, it would be funny. The
only thing that's funny is getting
ghosted, which Z's an expert at. Are you
Can I come back and play with my friend?
We're looking for the thing to revive
you, Jerry. Rarely. You're not nice. Had
to go down this way. Should I eat these
cluster shrooms? One at a time. One at a
time. I'll do it first. It's a rickety
bridge. Let's be careful. You're a
rickety bridge. Uhoh. Hey, the mushrooms
might be killing me. The mushrooms might
be killing me. The mushrooms might be
killing me. The mushrooms might be
killing me. Why would you eat the
mushroom? No, no, no, no, no. Does
anyone have an antidote? I'm using
bandages. That didn't help. Eddie, why
did you eat the mushroom? We're good. It
only poisoned me halfway. We're good,
guys. I'm very high up right now. We're
good, but it may have permanently ruined
me because now my stamina doesn't fill
more. Okay, so as you take injuries,
they fill up your stamina bar, so you
can't get more steak out. Do you see how
Zud went on his own way and it actually
he's further along? Yeah, I don't have
stamina anymore. The po the mushrooms
poison me. I don't know that I can get
up that. Yeah, Biff, I don't think
you're going to be able to climb that
high. Oh, wait. It's working out of my
system. Okay, cool, cool, cool. Now, I
think I can climb this. I'm a I'm a
pathfinder. Okay, stop saying
pathfinder. Biff, you don't have the
strength to get up there, dude. Yeah,
you don't have the button. Yeah, little
noodle arms. You haven't been to the
gym. Yeah, whatever you say. Hey. Yeah,
Zud's like way further ahead of us. Oh
my gosh, Z's killing it. Why do we go
this way? What do you mean? Why do we go
this way? I followed Biffle and I regret
it.
I'm going back. I'm going up to go up.
I'm going up to go up, Biffle, cuz I
have very low health. All right. Well,
tell me something. I don't know. Hey, Z
said you guys suck. I agree, but it's
just Biffle. All right. Okay. My poison
is gone. My happiness remains. I have
little stamina now and my whole bar is
hungry and I'm going to Well, we need to
forage, but you've been leading us on a
wild goose chase. Jerome, have you found
the statue yet? I can't go. I literally
am stuck spectating you guys. I can't do
nothing. Well, I'm trying to res you,
but you won't let me. I don't think I
can make it up this. Well, Bipple, I
have to rescue Jerome, so I used them
already. Are you serious? Well, I was
poisoned, so I put a bandage on it. What
is this game? Fun, actually. I really
like it. Yeah, I'm going to do three
videos. I would like it more if the
cursed skull wasn't cursed. Yeah, I
Jerome again I like I feel bad but also
you did commune with the dead. What a
dumb idea. Why would they put that in
the game in the first 30 seconds? Cuz
this is a meme randomly generated game.
I can't.
Do you see that? Do you see that? That
was literally a built different mountain
climber. Is this the path that we should
go? I think we should go left. Go. I
don't Oh, I'm out of energy. Oh no. I'm
out of Oh, no. No. No. No. No. I don't
have enough energy. We have to go down.
Okay. We got to go down to go up. I
always tell you that I don't think you
guys are making it. I think Jerome,
you're already dead. So, I don't know
how to tell you that you haven't made
it, but No, no, no.
Did we lose Biffle? Biffle. Biffle.
Yeah, Biff's dead. Is he dead? He's
dead. He's definitely dead. Biff, of
course he is. I followed Biffle.
Oh, great. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Okay. All right. All right.
Oh, you almost just Oh, hey. Okay. I was
following you guys the whole time. So, I
was unconscious. If one of you guys came
and grabbed me, I would have been alive
right now. But I'm dead. Yeah, we can't.
Oh, when you're unconscious, you can't
talk. Great. Why? Where? Where? Son, how
am I in this horrible spot? This is me
me looking into the camera saying that
this is going to be bad. We got to risk
it for the biscuit. Risk it for the
biscuit. Risk it for the biscuit. Risk
it for the biscuit. The fog rises. What
does that mean? Oh no. Wait, did Jerome
just get revived? The fog is rising.
That seems bad.
They're all talking. They're all so far
up there. Okay. Oh, this is the way.
Dude, I'm so built different right now.
It just be like a random chance. What?
Cool. Nope.
Doing my best.
I hear you. Oh no. Oh no. Please don't
poison. Please don't poison me. Please
don't poison me. Please don't poison me.
Give me my hunger. Give me my hunger. I
might die. Yep. I have no nothing. Oh
no. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
Great. Can somebody revive me? Snap out
of it, bro. So, if you confuse, if you
consume your stamina, you pass out.
Makes sense. I'm alive. I need stamina
to come back. I'm going to be here for
like an hour and the fog is going to
rise.
Okay. Progress, progress. I'm just
having like a solo adventure, dude,
after I got abandoned by everybody.
Pimple must be alive cuz he hasn't come
to haunt me. Dude, if there's an ancient
skull, a cure all. Oh, give me this.
What is that? Cusco's poison. Z, I hear
you.
I hear them yelling my name. Bibble
leads me on a freaking goose chase. Then
he dies and then gets rescued and he
gets resed ahead of me.
Oh, that's Nope. Oh. Oh, great. Drink my
cure all. Oh, nope. I died. And now I'm
dead. And they're looking for me. Is
Drum alive? Oh, Drum has a campfire.
Bro, I can't believe I got abandoned
like this. And here I am slowly bleeding
out with no one coming to save me. No.
Great. I died. Oh, he died. Oh my god.
Okay, we can we can light the fire.
Imagine 4 hours. We spent We've been
waiting for you guys. You've been
waiting for me to die. Yes. For like 20
minutes. You guys abandoned me and left

a mountain. We did it.
Uh guys, wait. You won? Yeah. No, this
way. Oh my gosh. There's There's more.
Okay, so we could grab this. Oh my see

whole way. No, I'm not making it. No,
