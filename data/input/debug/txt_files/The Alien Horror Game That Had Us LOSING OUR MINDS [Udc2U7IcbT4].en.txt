going to give me the win? Maybe.
Bang. It's going to take Jacob like 20
minutes to realize I'm not alive
anymore. What?

Okay. Wait, wait. Look on the floor.
Look on the floor. That's so many
circuits. Turn on the power and shake it
in my face. What? She went and I
Oh, you literally just turned on the
electric. In my honest opinion, thus
far, this game has been really good with
the scares, but just the puzzle aspect,
my brain is at 1 HP. I've never had to
do this this many puzzles in this many
instances
before. Wait a minute. I have that one
