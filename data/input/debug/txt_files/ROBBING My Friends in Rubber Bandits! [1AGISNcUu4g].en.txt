said plenty of times before, Josh has
this thing known as plot armor. Yeah,
you have to help me out here. Is going
to be doing really good and just there's
nothing we can do about it. It's not
plot armor. It is plot armor. You're
like the main character in an anime and
we're just the sideline characters. Josh

about we kiss and make up? Really?
You're talking about me and you or you
and Josh or me, you and Josh? You and
Josh? No, you said we and I'm not you.
Hey, hey, hey. We're on the same side
place. Listen, Josh. If I'm going to go

it was pretty good. Oh, you both. It's a
draw. I swear. I win. Yeah.
How? How? I deserve that. That was an
incredible throw. Behalf of me. I got to
say Finn is getting dangerous at
throwing in this game. Yeah. And he
said, he said, "I got pla." He did
great. So, I'm throwing, but Josh is
seems like you just suck, Krina. No,
what's going on here is that they're
letting the new guy shine shine. They're
letting the new guy shine in the anime
now. So, what they're doing is they're
letting Why are we in an anime? I don't
know. Everything in my life is an anime
right now, Josh. I watch it too much.
Now, let's fight to the death. Ooh, a

armor from, man? I don't know. It just
kind of happened to have it. Where did
you get the armor from? I've got to kill
you, Finn.
