00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
rescue with zero effort. And I I I think
 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.110 align:start position:0%
rescue with zero effort. And I I I think
it<00:00:31.599><c> could</c><00:00:31.679><c> be</c><00:00:31.840><c> worded</c><00:00:32.160><c> a</c><00:00:32.399><c> little</c><00:00:32.480><c> better.</c><00:00:32.960><c> Does</c>

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
it could be worded a little better. Does
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.270 align:start position:0%
it could be worded a little better. Does
that<00:00:33.280><c> mean</c><00:00:33.440><c> that</c><00:00:34.160><c> zero</c><00:00:34.559><c> effort</c><00:00:34.880><c> for</c><00:00:35.120><c> the</c>

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
that mean that zero effort for the
 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.510 align:start position:0%
that mean that zero effort for the
person<00:00:35.600><c> we're</c><00:00:35.840><c> rescuing</c><00:00:36.399><c> or</c><00:00:36.640><c> is</c><00:00:36.880><c> is</c><00:00:37.120><c> that</c><00:00:37.280><c> our</c>

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
zero effort? Like which one is that?
 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.790 align:start position:0%
zero effort? Like which one is that?
It's<00:00:40.239><c> like</c><00:00:40.559><c> zero</c><00:00:41.120><c> effort</c><00:00:41.520><c> is</c><00:00:41.760><c> needed</c><00:00:42.320><c> to</c><00:00:42.559><c> put</c>

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
It's like zero effort is needed to put
 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.110 align:start position:0%
It's like zero effort is needed to put

hanging<00:01:29.840><c> over</c><00:01:30.080><c> a</c><00:01:30.240><c> bridge.</c><00:01:31.159><c> Oh,</c><00:01:32.159><c> okay.</c><00:01:32.880><c> Wait,</c>

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
hanging over a bridge. Oh, okay. Wait,
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.390 align:start position:0%
hanging over a bridge. Oh, okay. Wait,
wait,<00:01:33.280><c> wait.</c><00:01:33.520><c> Okay,</c><00:01:33.759><c> okay.</c><00:01:34.000><c> Think,</c><00:01:34.240><c> think,</c>

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
wait, wait. Okay, okay. Think, think,
 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.710 align:start position:0%
wait, wait. Okay, okay. Think, think,
think.<00:01:34.960><c> What</c><00:01:35.119><c> equipment</c><00:01:35.439><c> are</c><00:01:35.600><c> we</c><00:01:35.759><c> bringing?</c>

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
think. What equipment are we bringing?
 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.230 align:start position:0%
think. What equipment are we bringing?
So,<00:01:36.880><c> the</c><00:01:37.119><c> teley</c><00:01:37.439><c> handler</c><00:01:37.759><c> could</c><00:01:37.920><c> be</c><00:01:38.079><c> really</c>

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
So, the teley handler could be really
 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.670 align:start position:0%
So, the teley handler could be really
useful,<00:01:38.560><c> but</c><00:01:38.799><c> we</c><00:01:38.960><c> need</c><00:01:39.040><c> to</c><00:01:39.119><c> get</c><00:01:39.200><c> there</c><00:01:39.439><c> quick.</c>

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
useful, but we need to get there quick.
 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.270 align:start position:0%
useful, but we need to get there quick.
So,<00:01:39.840><c> what</c><00:01:40.000><c> if</c><00:01:40.159><c> we</c><00:01:40.560><c> teley</c><00:01:41.000><c> handle</c><00:01:42.000><c> with</c><00:01:42.720><c> the</c><00:01:43.040><c> big</c>

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
So, what if we teley handle with the big
 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.109 align:start position:0%
So, what if we teley handle with the big
old<00:01:43.520><c> helicopter?</c><00:01:44.159><c> What?</c><00:01:44.560><c> Wait,</c><00:01:44.880><c> we're</c><00:01:45.040><c> going</c>

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
old helicopter? What? Wait, we're going
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.950 align:start position:0%

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
to attach the teley handler to the Okay,
 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.710 align:start position:0%
to attach the teley handler to the Okay,
that<00:01:47.119><c> sounds</c><00:01:47.280><c> great.</c><00:01:47.520><c> Um,</c><00:01:47.759><c> okay.</c><00:01:48.079><c> So,</c><00:01:48.320><c> just</c>
