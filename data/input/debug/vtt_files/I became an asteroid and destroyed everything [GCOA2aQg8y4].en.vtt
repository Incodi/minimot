That might be the best option I have.
 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.550 align:start position:0%
That might be the best option I have.

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
dangerous up there. Looks like there is
 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.990 align:start position:0%

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
boats swimming around that island. Do
 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.390 align:start position:0%
boats swimming around that island. Do

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
boats swim? They float and drive. And I
 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.150 align:start position:0%
boats swim? They float and drive. And I
just<00:04:56.639><c> roll</c><00:04:56.880><c> over</c><00:04:57.199><c> a</c><00:04:57.440><c> tree.</c><00:04:57.759><c> That</c><00:04:58.000><c> was</c>

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
just roll over a tree. That was
 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.390 align:start position:0%
just roll over a tree. That was
exciting.<00:04:59.040><c> I</c><00:04:59.280><c> like</c><00:04:59.360><c> how</c><00:04:59.520><c> the</c><00:04:59.680><c> trees</c><00:05:00.000><c> just</c><00:05:00.240><c> kind</c>

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
exciting. I like how the trees just kind
 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.550 align:start position:0%
exciting. I like how the trees just kind
of<00:05:00.639><c> fall</c><00:05:00.960><c> into</c><00:05:01.280><c> place,</c><00:05:01.600><c> unlike</c><00:05:02.000><c> Minecraft</c>

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
of fall into place, unlike Minecraft
 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.550 align:start position:0%

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
I never understood that. Like, real

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.749 align:start position:0%
talk. But all of this concrete makes me
grow<00:05:09.440><c> so</c><00:05:09.680><c> big</c><00:05:09.840><c> and</c><00:05:10.080><c> strong.</c><00:05:10.479><c> Oh</c><00:05:10.800><c> my</c><00:05:11.120><c> word.</c>

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
starting to get like more gravitational
 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.270 align:start position:0%
starting to get like more gravitational
pull,<00:05:17.840><c> so</c><00:05:18.080><c> things</c><00:05:18.320><c> are</c><00:05:18.720><c> like</c><00:05:18.960><c> getting</c>

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
pull, so things are like getting
 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.070 align:start position:0%
pull, so things are like getting

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
good. Now the problem is we're going to
 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.350 align:start position:0%
good. Now the problem is we're going to
have<00:05:29.680><c> to</c><00:05:29.759><c> run</c><00:05:29.919><c> through</c><00:05:30.080><c> the</c><00:05:30.320><c> ocean</c><00:05:30.560><c> again</c><00:05:31.039><c> to</c>

the next island. And that is a long way
away.<00:05:34.000><c> Also,</c><00:05:34.400><c> look</c><00:05:34.560><c> how</c><00:05:34.800><c> small</c><00:05:34.960><c> the</c><00:05:35.199><c> coconuts</c>

I'm lining it up directly and right over
it.<00:13:37.360><c> Oh</c><00:13:38.560><c> yes,</c><00:13:38.959><c> that</c><00:13:39.120><c> was</c><00:13:39.279><c> satisfying</c><00:13:40.399><c> a</c><00:13:40.639><c> little</c>

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.910 align:start position:0%

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.509 align:start position:0%
bit at the beginning, but that's okay.
Sometimes<00:13:44.320><c> I</c><00:13:44.560><c> even</c><00:13:44.720><c> leave</c><00:13:44.959><c> crumbs</c><00:13:45.279><c> when</c><00:13:45.440><c> I</c>

Sometimes I even leave crumbs when I
eat.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
eat.
 

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.509 align:start position:0%
eat.
Unless<00:13:48.079><c> it's</c><00:13:48.320><c> pizza,</c><00:13:48.720><c> then</c><00:13:48.959><c> then</c><00:13:49.200><c> the</c><00:13:49.440><c> whole</c>

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
entire pizza just I just Kirby it like
 

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.350 align:start position:0%
entire pizza just I just Kirby it like
and<00:13:55.200><c> it's</c><00:13:55.440><c> gone.</c><00:13:56.480><c> All</c><00:13:56.560><c> right,</c><00:13:56.720><c> we</c><00:13:56.959><c> still</c><00:13:57.120><c> have</c>

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
and it's gone. All right, we still have
 

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.870 align:start position:0%
and it's gone. All right, we still have
I<00:13:57.680><c> see</c><00:13:57.920><c> a</c><00:13:58.240><c> couple</c><00:13:58.720><c> other</c>

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
I see a couple other
 

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.670 align:start position:0%
I see a couple other
vehicles,<00:14:01.600><c> little</c><00:14:01.920><c> robots</c><00:14:02.320><c> going</c><00:14:02.639><c> over</c><00:14:02.800><c> here.</c>

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.509 align:start position:0%
vehicles, little robots going over here.
So,<00:14:03.839><c> I</c><00:14:04.079><c> think</c><00:14:04.160><c> we</c><00:14:04.399><c> need</c><00:14:04.480><c> to</c><00:14:04.720><c> drive</c><00:14:04.959><c> up,</c><00:14:05.279><c> take</c>

00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
So, I think we need to drive up, take
 

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:08.310 align:start position:0%
So, I think we need to drive up, take
them<00:14:05.600><c> out.</c><00:14:05.839><c> I've</c><00:14:06.000><c> got</c><00:14:06.079><c> my</c><00:14:06.240><c> shotgun</c><00:14:06.720><c> ready.</c><00:14:08.000><c> So,</c>

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
them out. I've got my shotgun ready. So,
 

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.990 align:start position:0%
them out. I've got my shotgun ready. So,
as<00:14:08.560><c> long</c><00:14:08.639><c> as</c><00:14:08.800><c> I</c><00:14:09.040><c> can</c><00:14:09.199><c> get</c><00:14:09.279><c> a</c><00:14:09.519><c> little</c><00:14:09.680><c> bigger.</c>

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
