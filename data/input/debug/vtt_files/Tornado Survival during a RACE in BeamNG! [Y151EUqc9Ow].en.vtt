00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
thing. Okay, I've used a reset now.
 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.750 align:start position:0%
thing. Okay, I've used a reset now.
Reset.<00:02:39.680><c> Boom.</c><00:02:40.080><c> Is</c><00:02:40.160><c> there</c><00:02:40.319><c> another</c><00:02:40.720><c> path?</c><00:02:41.599><c> I</c>

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
Reset. Boom. Is there another path? I
 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.110 align:start position:0%
Reset. Boom. Is there another path? I
mean,<00:02:41.920><c> all</c><00:02:42.080><c> we</c><00:02:42.160><c> have</c><00:02:42.319><c> to</c><00:02:42.400><c> do</c><00:02:42.480><c> is</c><00:02:42.640><c> get</c><00:02:42.720><c> up</c><00:02:42.879><c> to</c><00:02:42.959><c> the</c>

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
mean, all we have to do is get up to the
 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.589 align:start position:0%
mean, all we have to do is get up to the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.670 align:start position:0%
moving or is it just stuck there? I feel

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
like that one's stationary, so it's
 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.270 align:start position:0%
like that one's stationary, so it's

I'm not sure. Does this actually lead
all<00:03:18.400><c> the</c><00:03:18.480><c> way</c><00:03:18.560><c> up</c><00:03:18.920><c> or</c><00:03:19.920><c> I'm</c><00:03:20.080><c> trying</c><00:03:20.319><c> it?</c><00:03:21.760><c> We</c>

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.509 align:start position:0%
all the way up or I'm trying it? We
probably<00:03:22.239><c> should</c><00:03:22.400><c> have</c><00:03:22.560><c> just</c><00:03:22.720><c> turned</c><00:03:22.959><c> around.</c>

probably should have just turned around.
Um,<00:03:24.159><c> maybe</c><00:03:24.560><c> went</c><00:03:24.879><c> the</c><00:03:25.120><c> the</c><00:03:25.440><c> long</c><00:03:25.760><c> way.</c><00:03:26.319><c> Maybe.</c>

tires? It's actually pretty good. But
the<00:13:07.200><c> problem</c><00:13:07.360><c> is</c><00:13:07.519><c> is</c><00:13:07.760><c> that</c><00:13:07.920><c> we</c><00:13:08.079><c> have</c><00:13:08.240><c> to</c>

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
the problem is is that we have to
 

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.990 align:start position:0%
the problem is is that we have to
eventually<00:13:08.720><c> go</c><00:13:08.880><c> back</c><00:13:09.040><c> up</c><00:13:09.279><c> there.</c><00:13:09.760><c> Yeah,</c>

eventually go back up there. Yeah,
that's<00:13:10.160><c> what</c><00:13:10.320><c> I'm</c><00:13:10.480><c> thinking.</c><00:13:11.040><c> Okay,</c><00:13:11.279><c> I</c><00:13:11.440><c> got</c><00:13:11.519><c> a</c>

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm thinking. Okay, I got a
 

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.509 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm thinking. Okay, I got a
good<00:13:11.839><c> spot</c><00:13:12.079><c> right</c><00:13:12.240><c> here.</c><00:13:12.959><c> And</c><00:13:13.120><c> I</c><00:13:13.360><c> think</c>

00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
good spot right here. And I think
 

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:15.829 align:start position:0%
good spot right here. And I think
anytime<00:13:13.920><c> you</c><00:13:14.079><c> get</c><00:13:14.240><c> near</c><00:13:14.399><c> the</c><00:13:14.560><c> EF6,</c><00:13:15.279><c> it's</c>

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
anytime you get near the EF6, it's
 

00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:18.710 align:start position:0%
anytime you get near the EF6, it's
probably<00:13:16.240><c> going</c><00:13:16.680><c> to</c><00:13:17.680><c> There's</c><00:13:18.000><c> one</c><00:13:18.240><c> up</c><00:13:18.399><c> above</c>

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.150 align:start position:0%
probably going to There's one up above
us.<00:13:19.040><c> Okay,</c><00:13:19.279><c> there</c><00:13:19.360><c> we</c><00:13:19.440><c> go.</c><00:13:19.600><c> I'm</c><00:13:19.680><c> on</c><00:13:19.839><c> the</c><00:13:19.920><c> road.</c>
