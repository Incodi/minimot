when<00:01:34.360><c> it's</c><00:01:34.520><c> happened</c><00:01:34.759><c> on</c><00:01:34.920><c> stream</c><00:01:35.920><c> paladins</c>

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
when it's happened on stream paladins
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.429 align:start position:0%
when it's happened on stream paladins
would<00:01:36.520><c> crash</c><00:01:37.320><c> and</c><00:01:37.439><c> then</c><00:01:37.920><c> OBS</c><00:01:38.320><c> would</c><00:01:38.560><c> get</c><00:01:39.200><c> all</c>

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
would crash and then OBS would get all
 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.950 align:start position:0%
would crash and then OBS would get all
kinds<00:01:39.680><c> of</c><00:01:39.920><c> screwed</c><00:01:40.360><c> up</c><00:01:41.159><c> and</c><00:01:41.600><c> uh</c><00:01:42.119><c> yeah</c><00:01:42.360><c> it's</c><00:01:42.840><c> you</c>

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
know a bit of a problem so yeah uh that
 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.310 align:start position:0%
know a bit of a problem so yeah uh that
is<00:01:47.880><c> very</c><00:01:48.119><c> annoying</c><00:01:48.920><c> and</c><00:01:49.520><c> I've</c><00:01:49.719><c> also</c><00:01:50.040><c> had</c>

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.510 align:start position:0%
is on my computer just crashing period
right<00:01:57.360><c> like</c><00:01:57.479><c> I</c><00:01:57.560><c> would</c><00:01:57.719><c> open</c><00:01:57.960><c> blender</c><00:01:58.320><c> try</c><00:01:58.439><c> and</c>

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
right like I would open blender try and
 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.870 align:start position:0%
right like I would open blender try and

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
issues for the most part there were
 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.750 align:start position:0%
issues for the most part there were

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
still some stability problems and
 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.830 align:start position:0%
still some stability problems and

notably the black screen phenomenon did
 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.270 align:start position:0%
notably the black screen phenomenon did

sometimes happen even with the

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
underclock uh but yeah eventually you
 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.789 align:start position:0%

you've been on my twitch Channel

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 align:start position:0%

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.469 align:start position:0%
recently it got relatively worse it's

now<00:04:40.479><c> and</c><00:04:40.800><c> so</c><00:04:41.280><c> I</c><00:04:41.520><c> decided</c><00:04:41.960><c> to</c><00:04:42.360><c> go</c><00:04:42.520><c> ahead</c><00:04:42.680><c> and</c>

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 align:start position:0%

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.270 align:start position:0%
now and so I decided to go ahead and
purchase<00:04:43.560><c> a</c><00:04:44.240><c> 12th</c><00:04:44.639><c> gen</c><00:04:45.240><c> Intel</c><00:04:45.720><c> CPU</c><00:04:46.600><c> which</c><00:04:47.000><c> was</c>

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
to see if I could socket that in and
 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.590 align:start position:0%
to see if I could socket that in and
have<00:04:53.360><c> you</c><00:04:53.479><c> know</c><00:04:53.759><c> yes</c><00:04:53.919><c> a</c><00:04:54.039><c> slightly</c><00:04:54.360><c> worse</c><00:04:54.639><c> CPU</c>

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
have you know yes a slightly worse CPU
 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.310 align:start position:0%
have you know yes a slightly worse CPU
but<00:04:56.080><c> a</c><00:04:56.240><c> CPU</c><00:04:56.680><c> that</c><00:04:56.800><c> would</c><00:04:56.960><c> be</c><00:04:58.039><c> stable</c><00:04:59.039><c> and</c><00:04:59.240><c> uh</c>

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 align:start position:0%
but a CPU that would be stable and uh

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
that that is basically taking your
 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.270 align:start position:0%
that that is basically taking your

then putting it back together again like

then putting it back together again like
that's<00:05:21.880><c> that's</c><00:05:22.080><c> not</c><00:05:22.240><c> something</c><00:05:22.520><c> I</c><00:05:22.639><c> wanted</c><00:05:22.880><c> to</c>

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's not something I wanted to
 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.270 align:start position:0%
that's that's not something I wanted to
do<00:05:23.160><c> I</c><00:05:23.240><c> wanted</c><00:05:23.440><c> to</c><00:05:23.600><c> avoid</c><00:05:23.840><c> that</c><00:05:23.960><c> at</c><00:05:24.080><c> all</c><00:05:24.280><c> cost</c><00:05:24.759><c> so</c>

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
do I wanted to avoid that at all cost so
 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.469 align:start position:0%
do I wanted to avoid that at all cost so
downgrading<00:05:26.039><c> seemed</c><00:05:26.440><c> like</c><00:05:26.720><c> a</c><00:05:26.919><c> reasonable</c>

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
downgrading seemed like a reasonable
 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.230 align:start position:0%
downgrading seemed like a reasonable
option<00:05:28.160><c> and</c><00:05:28.240><c> I</c><00:05:28.400><c> checked</c><00:05:28.680><c> and</c><00:05:28.800><c> made</c><00:05:28.960><c> sure</c><00:05:29.160><c> that</c>

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
option and I checked and made sure that
 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.350 align:start position:0%
option and I checked and made sure that
the<00:05:29.360><c> 12</c><00:05:29.759><c> gen</c><00:05:29.960><c> would</c><00:05:30.080><c> be</c><00:05:30.240><c> compatible</c><00:05:30.759><c> with</c><00:05:30.919><c> my</c>

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
the 12 gen would be compatible with my
 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.590 align:start position:0%
the 12 gen would be compatible with my

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
motherboard and it seem like it would be
 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
motherboard and it seem like it would be
fine<00:05:33.800><c> so</c><00:05:34.039><c> I</c><00:05:34.720><c> got</c><00:05:34.880><c> the</c><00:05:35.039><c> 12th</c><00:05:35.319><c> gen</c><00:05:35.639><c> CPU</c><00:05:36.400><c> and</c><00:05:36.520><c> I</c><00:05:36.600><c> got</c>

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
fine so I got the 12th gen CPU and I got
 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.270 align:start position:0%
fine so I got the 12th gen CPU and I got
some<00:05:36.919><c> thermal</c><00:05:37.240><c> paste</c><00:05:37.520><c> so</c><00:05:37.720><c> I</c><00:05:37.800><c> could</c><00:05:37.960><c> actually</c>

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
some thermal paste so I could actually
 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.550 align:start position:0%
some thermal paste so I could actually
you<00:05:38.400><c> know</c><00:05:38.560><c> make</c><00:05:38.680><c> sure</c><00:05:38.800><c> it</c><00:05:38.880><c> was</c><00:05:39.000><c> cooled</c>

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
you know make sure it was cooled
 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.510 align:start position:0%
you know make sure it was cooled

and uh if I ever were to switch out the

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:56.919 align:start position:0%
the coolant fan off that was easy I went
 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.150 align:start position:0%
the coolant fan off that was easy I went

and<00:07:00.440><c> pull</c><00:07:00.720><c> the</c><00:07:00.840><c> CPU</c><00:07:01.240><c> out</c><00:07:01.360><c> and</c><00:07:01.520><c> that</c><00:07:01.639><c> was</c><00:07:01.840><c> all</c>

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 align:start position:0%

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.550 align:start position:0%
going for but it's a lot so I didn't

actually physically sweating because of

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's always been a little bit daunting
 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.950 align:start position:0%
that's always been a little bit daunting
to

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
to
 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.469 align:start position:0%
to

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
me
 

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:36.270 align:start position:0%
me
and<00:07:33.479><c> yeah</c><00:07:33.720><c> so</c><00:07:34.160><c> I</c><00:07:35.160><c> inevitably</c><00:07:35.800><c> just</c><00:07:36.000><c> put</c><00:07:36.160><c> the</c>

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
and yeah so I inevitably just put the
 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.790 align:start position:0%
and yeah so I inevitably just put the
CPU<00:07:36.840><c> into</c><00:07:37.280><c> the</c><00:07:37.759><c> uh</c><00:07:37.960><c> the</c><00:07:38.039><c> computer</c><00:07:38.440><c> I</c><00:07:38.560><c> put</c><00:07:38.680><c> the</c>

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
CPU into the uh the computer I put the
 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.070 align:start position:0%
CPU into the uh the computer I put the
thermal<00:07:39.080><c> paste</c><00:07:39.280><c> on</c><00:07:39.440><c> ended</c><00:07:39.639><c> up</c><00:07:39.720><c> putting</c><00:07:39.960><c> too</c>

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
thermal paste on ended up putting too
 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.390 align:start position:0%
thermal paste on ended up putting too
much<00:07:40.240><c> thermal</c><00:07:40.520><c> paste</c><00:07:40.720><c> on</c><00:07:40.919><c> actually</c><00:07:41.400><c> but</c>

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
much thermal paste on actually but
 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.390 align:start position:0%
much thermal paste on actually but
better<00:07:42.639><c> too</c><00:07:42.840><c> much</c><00:07:43.039><c> than</c><00:07:43.160><c> not</c><00:07:43.440><c> enough</c><00:07:44.080><c> right</c>

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
better too much than not enough right
 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.189 align:start position:0%
better too much than not enough right
and<00:07:46.400><c> put</c><00:07:46.560><c> everything</c><00:07:46.800><c> back</c><00:07:47.000><c> together</c>

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
and put everything back together
 

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:49.510 align:start position:0%
and put everything back together
reassemble<00:07:47.599><c> it</c><00:07:47.680><c> went</c><00:07:47.840><c> to</c><00:07:47.919><c> turn</c><00:07:48.080><c> it</c>

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
reassemble it went to turn it
 

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.869 align:start position:0%
reassemble it went to turn it
on<00:07:50.520><c> it</c><00:07:50.639><c> didn't</c><00:07:50.840><c> turn</c><00:07:51.039><c> on</c><00:07:51.400><c> will</c><00:07:51.599><c> not</c><00:07:51.960><c> die</c><00:07:52.680><c> not</c>

00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
on it didn't turn on will not die not
 

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:58.070 align:start position:0%
on it didn't turn on will not die not
yet<00:07:53.080><c> it</c><00:07:53.199><c> didn't</c><00:07:53.400><c> turn</c><00:07:54.120><c> on</c><00:07:55.360><c> oh</c><00:07:56.360><c> that</c><00:07:56.560><c> was</c><00:07:57.400><c> so</c>

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
yet it didn't turn on oh that was so
 

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.149 align:start position:0%
yet it didn't turn on oh that was so
scary<00:07:59.080><c> uh</c><00:07:59.240><c> and</c><00:07:59.520><c> the</c><00:07:59.560><c> way</c><00:07:59.639><c> it</c><00:07:59.720><c> didn't</c><00:07:59.879><c> turn</c><00:08:00.039><c> on</c>

00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
scary uh and the way it didn't turn on
 

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:02.350 align:start position:0%
scary uh and the way it didn't turn on
was<00:08:00.319><c> basically</c><00:08:01.080><c> I</c><00:08:01.199><c> plugged</c><00:08:01.479><c> it</c><00:08:01.599><c> in</c><00:08:02.120><c> pressed</c>

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.360 align:start position:0%
was basically I plugged it in pressed
 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.749 align:start position:0%
was basically I plugged it in pressed
the<00:08:02.479><c> power</c><00:08:02.720><c> button</c><00:08:03.599><c> and</c><00:08:03.800><c> not</c><00:08:04.039><c> a</c><00:08:04.319><c> thing</c>

00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0%
the power button and not a thing
 

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:07.629 align:start position:0%
the power button and not a thing
happened<00:08:05.319><c> not</c><00:08:05.639><c> at</c><00:08:05.840><c> all</c><00:08:06.800><c> uh</c><00:08:07.000><c> double</c><00:08:07.240><c> check</c><00:08:07.520><c> that</c>

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
happened not at all uh double check that
 

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:08.909 align:start position:0%
happened not at all uh double check that
I<00:08:08.039><c> actually</c><00:08:08.159><c> flipped</c><00:08:08.479><c> the</c><00:08:08.520><c> switch</c><00:08:08.720><c> on</c><00:08:08.840><c> my</c>

00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:08.919 align:start position:0%
I actually flipped the switch on my
 

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:09.869 align:start position:0%
I actually flipped the switch on my
power<00:08:09.080><c> supply</c><00:08:09.319><c> and</c><00:08:09.400><c> everything</c><00:08:09.560><c> was</c><00:08:09.639><c> plugged</c>

00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:09.879 align:start position:0%
power supply and everything was plugged
 

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:11.550 align:start position:0%
power supply and everything was plugged
in<00:08:10.000><c> properly</c><00:08:10.280><c> it</c><00:08:10.440><c> was</c><00:08:10.840><c> so</c><00:08:11.039><c> yeah</c><00:08:11.199><c> that</c><00:08:11.319><c> wasn't</c>

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
in properly it was so yeah that wasn't
 

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.950 align:start position:0%
in properly it was so yeah that wasn't
working<00:08:11.879><c> that</c><00:08:12.000><c> was</c><00:08:12.599><c> scary</c><00:08:13.599><c> but</c><00:08:13.759><c> that's</c><00:08:13.960><c> not</c>

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
working that was scary but that's not
 

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.550 align:start position:0%
working that was scary but that's not
the<00:08:15.080><c> truly</c><00:08:15.720><c> most</c><00:08:15.960><c> scary</c><00:08:16.400><c> part</c><00:08:16.840><c> of</c><00:08:17.080><c> this</c><00:08:17.400><c> the</c>

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
most scary thing by far is I decided
 

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.589 align:start position:0%
most scary thing by far is I decided
okay<00:08:21.759><c> well</c><00:08:21.919><c> this</c><00:08:22.039><c> isn't</c><00:08:22.360><c> working</c><00:08:23.360><c> let</c><00:08:23.520><c> me</c><00:08:24.240><c> put</c>

okay well this isn't working let me put
 

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:28.430 align:start position:0%
okay well this isn't working let me put

back in the 13th gen and make sure that
 

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.629 align:start position:0%

okay<00:10:17.279><c> eventually</c><00:10:17.920><c> he</c><00:10:18.040><c> suss</c><00:10:18.440><c> out</c><00:10:18.600><c> the</c><00:10:18.959><c> problem</c>

00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:19.959 align:start position:0%
okay eventually he suss out the problem
 

00:10:19.959 --> 00:10:22.030 align:start position:0%
okay eventually he suss out the problem
and<00:10:20.079><c> we</c><00:10:20.200><c> finally</c><00:10:20.519><c> get</c><00:10:20.640><c> to</c><00:10:20.760><c> the</c><00:10:20.920><c> part</c><00:10:21.800><c> where</c><00:10:21.959><c> I</c>

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
and we finally get to the part where I
 

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.870 align:start position:0%
and we finally get to the part where I
feel<00:10:22.320><c> like</c><00:10:22.480><c> an</c><00:10:23.320><c> absolute</c>

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
feel like an absolute
 

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.590 align:start position:0%
feel like an absolute
colossal<00:10:25.880><c> Monumental</c>

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
colossal Monumental

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:10:33.079><c> when</c><00:10:33.240><c> you</c><00:10:33.440><c> put</c><00:10:33.600><c> in</c><00:10:33.720><c> a</c><00:10:33.959><c> CPU</c><00:10:34.640><c> into</c><00:10:34.959><c> the</c>

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
alignment there's a for Intel CPUs and
 

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.670 align:start position:0%
alignment there's a for Intel CPUs and
motherboards<00:10:42.959><c> there's</c><00:10:43.160><c> a</c><00:10:43.399><c> triangle</c><00:10:44.120><c> which</c>

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
motherboards there's a triangle which
 

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.069 align:start position:0%
motherboards there's a triangle which

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
it there's a triangle on the motherboard
 

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.350 align:start position:0%
it there's a triangle on the motherboard
and<00:10:47.279><c> then</c><00:10:47.399><c> a</c><00:10:47.480><c> matching</c><00:10:47.800><c> triangle</c><00:10:48.160><c> on</c><00:10:48.240><c> the</c>

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
and then a matching triangle on the

00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
socket and you're supposed to make it so
 

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.230 align:start position:0%

those<00:10:49.519><c> triangles</c><00:10:49.839><c> are</c><00:10:49.959><c> on</c><00:10:50.040><c> the</c><00:10:50.160><c> same</c>

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
those triangles are on the same
 

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.949 align:start position:0%
those triangles are on the same

00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:56.590 align:start position:0%

again<00:10:55.279><c> I'm</c><00:10:55.519><c> totally</c><00:10:55.839><c> out</c><00:10:55.920><c> of</c><00:10:56.040><c> my</c><00:10:56.160><c> depth</c><00:10:56.399><c> on</c>

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
again I'm totally out of my depth on
 

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.990 align:start position:0%
again I'm totally out of my depth on
this<00:10:57.399><c> so</c><00:10:57.720><c> I</c><00:10:57.800><c> thought</c><00:10:57.959><c> I</c><00:10:58.079><c> saw</c><00:10:58.279><c> a</c><00:10:58.440><c> triangle</c><00:10:58.920><c> when</c>

00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
this so I thought I saw a triangle when
 

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.629 align:start position:0%
this so I thought I saw a triangle when
I<00:10:59.079><c> was</c><00:10:59.320><c> slotting</c><00:10:59.639><c> in</c><00:10:59.760><c> the</c>

00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
I was slotting in the
 

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:04.389 align:start position:0%
I was slotting in the

00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
CPU that was not the right triangle and
 

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:06.069 align:start position:0%
CPU that was not the right triangle and
in<00:11:04.639><c> hindsight</c><00:11:05.160><c> I</c><00:11:05.279><c> probably</c><00:11:05.560><c> should</c><00:11:05.720><c> have</c>

00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
in hindsight I probably should have
 

00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:08.430 align:start position:0%
in hindsight I probably should have
realized<00:11:06.720><c> that</c><00:11:07.600><c> but</c><00:11:07.680><c> you</c><00:11:07.760><c> know</c><00:11:07.920><c> hindsight</c><00:11:08.320><c> is</c>

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
realized that but you know hindsight is
 

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.269 align:start position:0%
realized that but you know hindsight is
2020<00:11:08.959><c> and</c><00:11:09.079><c> at</c><00:11:09.200><c> the</c><00:11:09.320><c> time</c><00:11:09.480><c> I</c><00:11:09.560><c> was</c><00:11:09.800><c> so</c><00:11:10.279><c> nervous</c>

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
2020 and at the time I was so nervous
 

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:13.790 align:start position:0%
2020 and at the time I was so nervous
that<00:11:11.720><c> like</c><00:11:12.160><c> I</c><00:11:12.240><c> was</c><00:11:12.440><c> just</c><00:11:12.639><c> trying</c><00:11:12.959><c> to</c><00:11:13.279><c> spend</c><00:11:13.600><c> as</c>

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
that like I was just trying to spend as
 

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.190 align:start position:0%
that like I was just trying to spend as
little<00:11:14.040><c> time</c><00:11:14.200><c> in</c><00:11:14.360><c> the</c><00:11:14.480><c> computer</c><00:11:14.839><c> case</c><00:11:15.040><c> as</c>

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
little time in the computer case as
 

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.310 align:start position:0%
little time in the computer case as
possible<00:11:15.519><c> because</c><00:11:15.680><c> I</c><00:11:15.760><c> was</c><00:11:15.880><c> so</c><00:11:16.000><c> scared</c><00:11:16.240><c> of</c>

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
possible because I was so scared of
 

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.790 align:start position:0%
possible because I was so scared of
breaking<00:11:16.920><c> something</c><00:11:18.079><c> so</c><00:11:19.120><c> yeah</c><00:11:20.120><c> turns</c><00:11:20.720><c> out</c><00:11:21.720><c> I</c>

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
breaking something so yeah turns out I
 

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.870 align:start position:0%
breaking something so yeah turns out I
had<00:11:22.040><c> put</c><00:11:22.800><c> both</c><00:11:23.279><c> chips</c><00:11:23.800><c> in</c><00:11:24.560><c> upside</c>

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
had put both chips in upside
 

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.509 align:start position:0%
had put both chips in upside
down<00:11:27.880><c> you</c><00:11:28.000><c> know</c><00:11:28.240><c> that</c><00:11:28.880><c> that's</c><00:11:29.040><c> kind</c><00:11:29.360><c> of</c><00:11:29.440><c> a</c>

00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
down you know that that's kind of a
 

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:31.069 align:start position:0%
down you know that that's kind of a
rookie<00:11:29.800><c> mistake</c><00:11:30.200><c> and</c><00:11:30.320><c> that's</c><00:11:30.480><c> also</c><00:11:30.680><c> kind</c><00:11:30.839><c> of</c><00:11:30.920><c> a</c>

00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
rookie mistake and that's also kind of a
 

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:31.630 align:start position:0%
rookie mistake and that's also kind of a
big

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
big
 

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.790 align:start position:0%
big
[Laughter]

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.350 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
problem<00:11:34.800><c> no</c>

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
problem no
 

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.350 align:start position:0%
problem no
okay

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.509 align:start position:0%
okay
so<00:11:40.360><c> yeah</c><00:11:40.839><c> that's</c><00:11:41.040><c> a</c><00:11:41.360><c> massive</c><00:11:41.800><c> blunder</c><00:11:42.519><c> and</c><00:11:43.279><c> no</c>

00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's a massive blunder and no
 

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:46.790 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's a massive blunder and no
wonder<00:11:43.920><c> my</c><00:11:44.120><c> computer</c><00:11:44.519><c> was</c><00:11:44.720><c> not</c><00:11:44.959><c> turning</c><00:11:45.800><c> off</c>

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
wonder my computer was not turning off
 

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.030 align:start position:0%
wonder my computer was not turning off
and<00:11:46.920><c> here's</c><00:11:47.120><c> where</c><00:11:47.279><c> it</c><00:11:47.399><c> gets</c><00:11:47.600><c> I</c><00:11:47.720><c> guess</c><00:11:47.880><c> a</c>

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
and here's where it gets I guess a
 

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.350 align:start position:0%
and here's where it gets I guess a
little<00:11:48.320><c> bit</c><00:11:48.600><c> sad</c><00:11:49.399><c> so</c><00:11:50.399><c> uh</c><00:11:50.800><c> the</c><00:11:50.920><c> guy</c><00:11:51.079><c> who</c><00:11:51.200><c> was</c>

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
little bit sad so uh the guy who was
 

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.910 align:start position:0%
little bit sad so uh the guy who was
working<00:11:51.720><c> there</c><00:11:51.959><c> he</c><00:11:52.480><c> uh</c><00:11:53.000><c> he</c><00:11:53.279><c> basically</c><00:11:53.600><c> cleaned</c>

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
working there he uh he basically cleaned
 

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.069 align:start position:0%
working there he uh he basically cleaned
up<00:11:54.079><c> all</c><00:11:54.200><c> the</c><00:11:54.320><c> stuff</c><00:11:54.519><c> cleaned</c><00:11:54.800><c> off</c><00:11:54.920><c> all</c><00:11:55.000><c> the</c>

00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
up all the stuff cleaned off all the
 

00:11:55.079 --> 00:11:56.670 align:start position:0%
up all the stuff cleaned off all the
thermal<00:11:55.399><c> paste</c><00:11:55.760><c> made</c><00:11:55.920><c> sure</c><00:11:56.160><c> everything</c><00:11:56.399><c> was</c>

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
thermal paste made sure everything was
 

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.069 align:start position:0%

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
cleaned that off and he put the 12th gen
 

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.790 align:start position:0%
cleaned that off and he put the 12th gen

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.870 align:start position:0%

actually<00:12:15.440><c> we</c><00:12:15.560><c> got</c><00:12:15.760><c> more</c><00:12:16.079><c> progress</c><00:12:16.560><c> than</c><00:12:16.680><c> we</c>

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
turn on and it didn't Boot and so we
 

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.230 align:start position:0%
turn on and it didn't Boot and so we
decided<00:12:39.079><c> okay</c><00:12:39.440><c> might</c><00:12:39.600><c> be</c><00:12:39.720><c> a</c><00:12:39.839><c> busted</c><00:12:40.240><c> chip</c><00:12:40.839><c> I</c>

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
decided okay might be a busted chip I
 

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.750 align:start position:0%
decided okay might be a busted chip I
hypothesized<00:12:42.000><c> maybe</c><00:12:42.240><c> there's</c><00:12:42.440><c> something</c><00:12:42.680><c> to</c>

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
hypothesized maybe there's something to
 

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.069 align:start position:0%
hypothesized maybe there's something to

00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
do with the BIOS settings that's not
 

00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:47.509 align:start position:0%
do with the BIOS settings that's not
allowing<00:12:44.440><c> to</c><00:12:44.600><c> boot</c><00:12:45.399><c> but</c><00:12:45.760><c> uh</c><00:12:46.360><c> basically</c><00:12:47.320><c> we</c>

00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
allowing to boot but uh basically we
 

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:49.150 align:start position:0%
allowing to boot but uh basically we
ended<00:12:47.760><c> up</c><00:12:47.920><c> swapping</c><00:12:48.320><c> that</c><00:12:48.560><c> back</c><00:12:48.720><c> to</c><00:12:48.920><c> the</c>

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
ended up swapping that back to the
 

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.870 align:start position:0%
ended up swapping that back to the

original chip that I had in the computer
 

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.269 align:start position:0%
original chip that I had in the computer
put<00:12:51.000><c> it</c><00:12:51.120><c> in</c><00:12:51.320><c> right</c><00:12:51.560><c> side</c><00:12:51.720><c> up</c><00:12:52.560><c> uh</c><00:12:52.920><c> gave</c><00:12:53.160><c> the</c>

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
put it in right side up uh gave the
 

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:56.230 align:start position:0%
put it in right side up uh gave the

00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
the case but maybe it'll feel a little
 

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:53.550 align:start position:0%
the case but maybe it'll feel a little

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%

a faulty 13th gen Intel CPU in my

there<00:14:03.000><c> are</c><00:14:03.399><c> stability</c><00:14:04.040><c> problems</c><00:14:04.440><c> over</c><00:14:04.639><c> the</c>

there are stability problems over the

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
next few weeks uh I guess I'm going to
 

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.550 align:start position:0%
next few weeks uh I guess I'm going to
have<00:14:08.000><c> to</c><00:14:08.160><c> try</c><00:14:08.320><c> and</c><00:14:08.480><c> find</c><00:14:08.680><c> a</c><00:14:08.880><c> different</c><00:14:09.160><c> way</c><00:14:09.320><c> to</c>

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%

fix this now if you heard what I just
 

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.189 align:start position:0%
fix this now if you heard what I just
