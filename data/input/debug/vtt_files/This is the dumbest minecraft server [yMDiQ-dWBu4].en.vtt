no<00:00:09.040><c> one</c><00:00:09.200><c> knew</c><00:00:09.360><c> it</c><00:00:09.519><c> was</c><00:00:09.679><c> me.</c><00:00:10.000><c> And</c><00:00:10.160><c> that's</c>

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
no one knew it was me. And that's
 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.990 align:start position:0%
no one knew it was me. And that's
because<00:00:10.559><c> I</c><00:00:10.719><c> bought</c><00:00:10.880><c> a</c><00:00:11.120><c> new</c><00:00:11.280><c> Minecraft</c><00:00:11.679><c> account</c>

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
because I bought a new Minecraft account
 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.589 align:start position:0%
because I bought a new Minecraft account
just<00:00:12.240><c> for</c><00:00:12.400><c> that.</c><00:00:12.719><c> So</c><00:00:12.960><c> hopefully</c><00:00:13.200><c> no</c><00:00:13.440><c> one</c>

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
just for that. So hopefully no one
 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.350 align:start position:0%
just for that. So hopefully no one
notices<00:00:14.000><c> me.</c><00:00:14.320><c> The</c><00:00:14.559><c> first</c><00:00:14.639><c> thing</c><00:00:14.799><c> I</c><00:00:14.960><c> needed</c><00:00:15.200><c> to</c>

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
notices me. The first thing I needed to
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.269 align:start position:0%
notices me. The first thing I needed to
do<00:00:15.519><c> was</c><00:00:15.759><c> find</c><00:00:15.920><c> out</c><00:00:16.080><c> who</c><00:00:16.240><c> the</c><00:00:16.400><c> owner</c><00:00:16.720><c> was.</c><00:00:17.119><c> I</c>

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
do was find out who the owner was. I
 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.550 align:start position:0%
do was find out who the owner was. I
think<00:00:17.359><c> I</c><00:00:17.600><c> should</c><00:00:17.680><c> have</c><00:00:17.840><c> done</c><00:00:18.000><c> some</c><00:00:18.240><c> research</c>

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
think I should have done some research
 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.230 align:start position:0%
think I should have done some research
before<00:00:18.800><c> joining.</c><00:00:19.279><c> I</c><00:00:19.439><c> got</c><00:00:19.520><c> some</c><00:00:19.760><c> wood</c><00:00:19.920><c> and</c><00:00:20.080><c> made</c>

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
before joining. I got some wood and made
 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.750 align:start position:0%
before joining. I got some wood and made
a<00:00:20.400><c> pickaxe.</c><00:00:20.800><c> And</c><00:00:20.880><c> then</c><00:00:21.039><c> I</c><00:00:21.199><c> walked</c><00:00:21.359><c> for</c><00:00:21.520><c> a</c><00:00:21.680><c> bit</c>

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
a pickaxe. And then I walked for a bit
 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.269 align:start position:0%
a pickaxe. And then I walked for a bit
and<00:00:22.000><c> found</c><00:00:22.160><c> another</c><00:00:22.480><c> player,</c><00:00:22.800><c> but</c><00:00:23.039><c> that</c><00:00:23.199><c> was</c>

almost ready to give up, but then
 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.149 align:start position:0%
almost ready to give up, but then
something<00:01:16.960><c> happened.</c><00:01:17.360><c> I</c><00:01:17.520><c> checked</c><00:01:17.680><c> the</c><00:01:17.840><c> tab</c>

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
something happened. I checked the tab
 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.590 align:start position:0%
something happened. I checked the tab

not,<00:01:23.360><c> but</c><00:01:23.600><c> he</c><00:01:23.759><c> probably</c><00:01:24.080><c> knew</c><00:01:24.240><c> the</c><00:01:24.400><c> owner.</c><00:01:24.799><c> So</c>

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
not, but he probably knew the owner. So
 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.789 align:start position:0%
not, but he probably knew the owner. So
I<00:01:25.040><c> asked</c><00:01:25.280><c> to</c><00:01:25.439><c> teleport</c><00:01:25.840><c> to</c><00:01:26.000><c> him.</c><00:01:26.159><c> so</c><00:01:26.320><c> I</c><00:01:26.479><c> can</c><00:01:26.640><c> ask</c>

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
an idea struck me. If all three of us
 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.510 align:start position:0%
an idea struck me. If all three of us
could<00:02:14.000><c> team</c><00:02:14.239><c> up,</c><00:02:14.480><c> we</c><00:02:14.720><c> could</c><00:02:14.879><c> find</c><00:02:15.040><c> and</c><00:02:15.280><c> kill</c>

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
could team up, we could find and kill
 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.430 align:start position:0%
could team up, we could find and kill
the<00:02:15.760><c> real</c><00:02:16.000><c> owner.</c><00:02:16.400><c> So,</c><00:02:16.560><c> I</c><00:02:16.800><c> asked</c><00:02:16.959><c> the</c><00:02:17.200><c> team,</c>

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
the real owner. So, I asked the team,
 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.270 align:start position:0%
the real owner. So, I asked the team,
and<00:02:17.599><c> they</c><00:02:17.760><c> nodded</c><00:02:18.080><c> their</c><00:02:18.239><c> heads.</c><00:02:18.720><c> This</c><00:02:18.959><c> was</c><00:02:19.040><c> a</c>

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
and they nodded their heads. This was a
 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.150 align:start position:0%
and they nodded their heads. This was a
good<00:02:19.440><c> sign.</c><00:02:20.160><c> But</c><00:02:20.319><c> then,</c><00:02:20.959><c> all</c><00:02:21.040><c> right,</c><00:02:21.520><c> so</c><00:02:21.920><c> I</c>

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
good sign. But then, all right, so I
 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.990 align:start position:0%
good sign. But then, all right, so I
actually<00:02:22.480><c> have</c><00:02:22.640><c> a</c><00:02:22.879><c> little</c><00:02:23.040><c> idea.</c><00:02:23.520><c> You</c><00:02:23.760><c> guys</c>

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually have a little idea. You guys
 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.430 align:start position:0%
actually have a little idea. You guys
are<00:02:24.239><c> probably</c><00:02:24.560><c> not</c><00:02:24.800><c> going</c><00:02:24.879><c> to</c><00:02:24.959><c> like</c><00:02:25.200><c> this</c>

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
are probably not going to like this
 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.030 align:start position:0%
are probably not going to like this

was obviously very scared of my command
block,<00:04:38.240><c> so</c><00:04:38.400><c> I</c><00:04:38.560><c> decided</c><00:04:38.880><c> to</c><00:04:39.040><c> use</c><00:04:39.280><c> it</c><00:04:39.360><c> to</c><00:04:39.600><c> my</c>

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 align:start position:0%
block, so I decided to use it to my
 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.430 align:start position:0%
block, so I decided to use it to my
advantage.<00:04:40.240><c> I</c><00:04:40.479><c> told</c><00:04:40.560><c> him</c><00:04:40.720><c> that</c><00:04:40.880><c> my</c><00:04:41.040><c> goal</c><00:04:41.280><c> was</c>

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
advantage. I told him that my goal was
 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.110 align:start position:0%
advantage. I told him that my goal was
to<00:04:41.600><c> kill</c><00:04:41.759><c> the</c><00:04:42.000><c> owner</c><00:04:42.160><c> of</c><00:04:42.320><c> the</c><00:04:42.479><c> server.</c><00:04:42.800><c> So,</c><00:04:42.960><c> I</c>

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
to kill the owner of the server. So, I
 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.469 align:start position:0%
to kill the owner of the server. So, I
asked<00:04:43.280><c> him</c><00:04:43.440><c> who</c><00:04:43.600><c> the</c><00:04:43.759><c> owner</c><00:04:44.000><c> was,</c><00:04:44.160><c> and</c><00:04:44.320><c> he</c>

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
asked him who the owner was, and he
 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.070 align:start position:0%
asked him who the owner was, and he
didn't<00:04:44.720><c> answer.</c><00:04:45.040><c> And</c><00:04:45.199><c> then</c><00:04:45.360><c> he</c><00:04:45.520><c> just</c><00:04:45.759><c> started</c>

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
didn't answer. And then he just started
 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.990 align:start position:0%
didn't answer. And then he just started
walking<00:04:46.479><c> away.</c><00:04:46.960><c> This</c><00:04:47.199><c> wasn't</c><00:04:47.440><c> working</c><00:04:47.680><c> out.</c>

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
walking away. This wasn't working out.
 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.749 align:start position:0%
walking away. This wasn't working out.
So,<00:04:48.160><c> I</c><00:04:48.320><c> decided</c><00:04:48.639><c> to</c><00:04:48.800><c> follow</c><00:04:49.040><c> him.</c><00:04:49.280><c> And</c><00:04:49.440><c> if</c><00:04:49.600><c> he</c>

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
So, I decided to follow him. And if he
 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.350 align:start position:0%
So, I decided to follow him. And if he
did<00:04:49.919><c> anything</c><00:04:50.240><c> suspicious,</c><00:04:50.800><c> I</c><00:04:51.040><c> would</c><00:04:51.199><c> kill</c>
